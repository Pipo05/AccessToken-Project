**The Problem:**
Over 1.7 billion adults globally remain unbanked, lacking access to basic financial services. High transaction fees, limited access to banking infrastructure, and the inability to secure loans perpetuate financial exclusion in underserved regions.

The current financial system is riddled with inefficiencies:
- High fees for international remittances.
